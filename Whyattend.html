 <div class="q">Why is such a workshop on
fundamentals required now?</div>
      <p> It's buzzing hot, it's truly
interdisciplinary and it's much
more than just numbers:
Data Analytics and all the related
terms including Data Mining, Data
Warehousing, Data Sciences, Big
Data, and so on, have emerged as
important subjects of study across a
large variety of disciplines spanning
the Arts, Business, Commerce,
Humanities, Information and Natural
Sciences, and Social Sciences.</p>
<div class="q"> What you don't know that you
don't know could hurt more:</div>
<p>The processes of identification,
collection, storage, encoding,
retrieval and analysis of data, of all
forms, formats, and sizes, and the
sharing of the results thereof in all
these disciplines are ubiquitous and
important to users more than any
time before.</p>
<div class="q"> We're talking about competition
and success, not mere survival:</div><p>
In our hyper-competitive world, the
insights gained from proper and
distinctive data analysis can prove to
be the most important difference
between the finest success and
ordinary survival.</p>
<div class="q"> You better know the
fundamentals before diving into
the deep-end:</div><p>
Across our country, many such
Workshops, and other academic
events, focused on the deep-end of
Data Analytics and on the
technologies, continue to be
organized. It is hence necessary to
orient and guide young teacherresearchers,
research scholars and
post-graduate students towards the
fundamentals of Data Analysis and
Analytics, by providing them with a
thorough grounding in the subject,
and preparing them to dive into the
deep-end and emerge confidently
and successfully.</p>
<div class="q">But, can the fundamentals be
learned in only two days?</div><p>
Of course, yes. You are smart,
energetic, raring to learn and explore
the limits of your powers of
concentration, intelligence, visualization
and imagination. We know this game
inside out. The trick is to enable you
and inspire you to learn to learn, and
then you win and therefore we win.
We wonâ€™t be surprised if you will want
us to continue on Sunday, 14th
February, 2016 too, with more of the
subject. Hope you will keep everyone
at home well informed about your
programme, or shall we say adventure
into knowledge of the subject?
Just remember the fundamental equation:
 DATA = PATTERN + NOISE
Once you internalize this, everything else
will be very easy and smooth to learn.</p>
<div class="q">And, who's going to lead the
workshop?</div><p>
The Workshop will be led by Professor
L.S. Ganesh of IIT Madras. His
colleagues from IIT Madras and
professional experts from industry will
also share their knowledge and
expertise. All the Resource Persons are
acknowledged masters in their
disciplines and their inputs will be
interesting and inspiring.</p></div>

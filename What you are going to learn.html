<h3 class="q">What will happen after the workshop?
</h3> <p>The intent is to get you, the participant, interested in and
inspired to dive into Data Analysis and Analytics. The plan is
to follow-up on the Workshop with a one-day Seminar on the
same theme, but with wider and deeper knowledge inputs from
the academic and business contexts. Naturally, the Workshop
would have prepared you well to absorb and assimilate the
advanced knowledge inputs that will be shared during the
Seminar. Catalyzing your academic advancement in this
discipline is our primary purpose.
